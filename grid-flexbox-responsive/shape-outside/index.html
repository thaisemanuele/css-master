        <h2>Sunscreen is Your Best Friend</h2>
        <p>
          Slather on the sunscreen generously before stepping out. Look for a
          broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 to shield yourself from
          both UVA and UVB rays. Reapply every two hours or more frequently,
          especially if you've been swimming or sweating.

        <h2>Timing is Key</h2>
        <p>
          The sun is at its most intense between 10 am and 4 pm. Consider
          planning your beach adventure during early mornings or late afternoons
          when the sun's rays are gentler.

        <h2>Seek Shade Regularly</h2>
        <p>
          While we adore the warmth of the sun, taking breaks in the shade will
          prevent overexposure and give your skin a chance to cool down.
